One day a couple of fourth graders named Cartman and Butters left their home to become pirates.
They wanted to escape their parents rules so they left to live a life of freedom and lawlessness.
Upon arriving to their destination however, they realized that modern day pirates are nothing like how they are portrayed in movies.

Rather than being the adventerous and exciting pirates that they both saw in movies, these pirates were actually poor and did not have the grand and large ships that the Motley crew owned in the movie.
Cartman was furious and swore at the pirates that they had finally met in Somalia. The Somalian priates noticed the two boys and decided to take advantage of the situation and hold them hostage for randsom. The boys however could understand Somali and were confused at what the priates was asking for.
