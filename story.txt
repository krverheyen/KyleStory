One day a couple of fourth graders named Cartman and Butters left their home to become pirates.
They wanted to escape their parents rules so they left to live a life of freedom and lawlessness.
Upon arriving to their destination however, they realized that modern day pirates are nothing like how they are portrayed in movies.

Rather than being the adventerous and exciting pirates that they both saw in movies, these pirates were actually poor and did not have the grand and large ships that the Motley crew owned in the movie.
Cartman was furious and swore at the pirates that they had finally met in Somalia. The Somalian priates noticed the two boys and decided to take advantage of the situation and hold them hostage for randsom.
 The boys however couldn't understand Somali and were confused at what the priates was asking for. 


They then meet someone who pays the ransom and they are set free.
 Ignoring their good luck, Cartman then takes control of the ship to give to the pirates.
Cartman then tries to turn the pirates into the pirates he wants them to be. 

Seeing this, the pirates admired the confidence of the fourth graders.
They realized there's so much that they still have to learn. So they decided to build a school in a nearby island. They used all the money they recieved as ransom.
Cartman and Butters became teachers and taught the pirates evrything they knew.
Until one morning, when the pirates woke up to find themselves in jail. Turns out, Cartman and Butters were undercover police officers.

After the US goverment got ahold of this, the boys were hailed as heros. There was a day dedicated to them, named Cartman and Butters day, where all the kids got the day off school.
Cartman and Butters were now not only seen as heros by the US governmnet, but by their classmates as well. This story soon became a Oscar winning film starring Leonardo Dicaprio, 
and the boys were later written about in history textbooks.
